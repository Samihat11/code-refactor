# code-refactor

## Description

This was an assignment where we had to refactor the code to meet accessibility standards and structure it by using semantic elements and adding comments.

I learned the importance of documenting your thought process by adding comments. This makes it easier to debug when you run into a problem. I also learned the importance of meeting accessibility standards and by doing so the webpages become optimized for search engines.
